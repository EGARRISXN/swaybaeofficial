        Im a Full Time Content Creator as of June 2021. I stream nearly daily on
        Twitch, with daily uploads on YouTube. You can also find me on TikTok,
        Twitter, Threads, Facebook, and Instagram!
      </p>
      <p>
        Did I ever imagine this would be my lifestyle, even five years ago?
        Nope.
      </p>
      <p>Do I love it? Entirely!</p>
      <p>
        I create family friendly entertainment centered around the concepts of
        positive mental attitude in gaming with the mantra of leaving someones
        day better than I found it.

        My favorite part of streaming is my amazing community. You can find our
        Discord as you explore the website, but its a very safe, inclusive,
        supportive, and kind community that we have cultivated that I feel
        incredibly lucky to have in my chat as I stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to our amazing community, I am primarily a Hearthstone
        streamer, with a focus on Battlegrounds. I also personally enjoy
        Strategy games in general, Survival games, Indie games, Simulator games,
        and Sonic, the Hedgehog.
